Description: The WASH Severity Classification (WSC) is a new interagency global initiative
    led by the Global WASH Cluster, UNICEF, and IMPACT Initiatives. Developed at the global
    level through a participatory process, the WSC project aims to develop a
    standardized approach to classifying the severity of WASH needs and vulnerabilities across contexts.
