\title{Assign higher administrative unit data to a lower one}
\usage{
assign_hiAdmin2loAdmin(
  HiAdmin_df,
  HiAdmin_df_name,
  HiAdmin_df_sheet_name,
  HiAdmin_name,
  context,
  context_AP,
  WSC_AP,
  LoAdmin_df,
  LoAdmin_name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{HiAdmin_df}{data.frame with the higher administrative unit data}

\item{HiAdmin_df_name}{character string with the name of the
\code{HiAdmin_df} as is in the \code{data_source_name} column of
\code{context_AP}.}

\item{HiAdmin_df_sheet_name}{character string with the name of the
\code{sheet_name}}

\item{HiAdmin_name}{character string with the column name of the higher
administrative unit. Must be identical to the relevant column name in
\code{LoAdmin_df} to 4allow cross-reference.}

\item{context}{character string identifying the context to be used in the
function call.
This is to be used if multiple context (geographical or temporal) are being
analysed. For instance, if data is used for Burkina Faso in 2020 and 2019,
this column can help distinguish the indicators.}

\item{context_AP}{data.frame with context specific analysis plan (AP) that
links the indicators in the WSC AP to the datasets used in the context
analysis.
See an example [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pv1BBf32faE6J5tryubhVOsQJfGXaDb2t23KWGab52U/edit?usp=sharing) or in \code{WSCprocessing::context_AP}.}

\item{WSC_AP}{data.frame with the general WSC analysis plan (AP) than can be
found \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TKxD_DyBTTN6onxYiooqtcI_TVSwPfeE-t7ZHK1zzMU/edit?usp=sharing}{here}
or as an object in the package (```WSCprocessing::WSC_AP```)}

\item{LoAdmin_df}{data.frame with the lower administrative unit data. Can be
just a list of lower administrative levels.}

\item{LoAdmin_name}{character string with the column name of the higher
administrative unit. Must be identical to the relevant column name in
\code{LoAdmin_df} to allow cross-reference.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the aggregated data at a lower administrative level
}
\description{
As data is not always available at the required level, it might be needed to
assign/input data from a higher administrative unit to a lower one. For
instance,if a country has three administrative unit: region, province, and
communes, this function can help to bring data available only at the
region-level to a province-level data set.
