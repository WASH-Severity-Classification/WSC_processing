\title{Score WASH Insecurity Score (WIS)}
\usage{
score_WIS(
  .data,
  data_AP,
  WSC_AP = WSCprocessing::WSC_AP,
  WIS_water = WSCprocessing::WIS_water,
  WIS_sanitation = WSCprocessing::WIS_sanitation,
  WIS_final = WSCprocessing::WIS_final
)
}
\arguments{
\item{WSC_AP}{data.frame with the general WSC analysis plan (AP) than can be
found \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TKxD_DyBTTN6onxYiooqtcI_TVSwPfeE-t7ZHK1zzMU/edit?usp=sharing}{here} or as an object in the package (```WSCprocessing::WSC_AP```)}

\item{WIS_water}{data.frame with the scoring reference matrix for the Water
component of the WASH Insecurity Score (WIS)}

\item{WIS_sanitation}{data.frame with the scoring reference matrix for the
Sanitation component of the WIS}

\item{WIS_final}{data.frame with the scoring reference matrix for the final
score of the WIS}

\item{context_AP}{data.frame with context specific analysis plan (AP) that links
 the indicators in the WSC AP to the datasets used in the context analysis.
See an example [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pv1BBf32faE6J5tryubhVOsQJfGXaDb2t23KWGab52U/edit?usp=sharing) or in ```WSCprocessing::context_AP```.}

\item{context}{Character string identifying the context to be used in the function call.
This is to be used if multiple context (geographical or temporal) are being
analysed. For instance, if data is used for Burkina Faso in 2020 and 2019,
this column can help distinguish the indicators.}

\item{data}{data.frame containing the data to be analysed with the function}
}
\value{
a dataframe containing the results of the scoring for each household
   in the dataset. NAs are introduced if variables cannot be found or score
   calculated.
